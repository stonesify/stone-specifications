# Request for Comments (RFC) Process

The RFC (Request for Comments) process is a structured way to propose, discuss, and implement major changes or new features in the Stone Specifications. 
This process ensures that all significant contributions are reviewed and agreed upon by the community, 
aligning with the core principles and goals of Stone Specifications.

## Purpose

The purpose of the RFC process is to:
- Provide a structured approach for proposing changes.
- Encourage community discussion and feedback.
- Ensure that all contributions align with the core principles and goals of the Stone Specifications.

## When to Use the RFC Process

Use the RFC process for:
- Significant new features.
- Changes to existing features that impact other parts of the Stone Specifications.
- Deprecating existing features.
- Changes to the architectural principles or core practices.

## Process Overview

1. **Proposal Submission**: Submit an RFC document outlining the proposed change or feature.
2. **Community Review**: Engage the community in discussing and reviewing the proposal.
3. **Refinement**: Incorporate feedback and refine the proposal.
4. **Approval**: Achieve consensus and approval from maintainers.

## RFC Submission Guidelines

### Step 1: Proposal Submission

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your RFC: `git checkout -b rfc-my-feature`.
3. **Create the RFC Document**: Create a new file in the `rfcs` directory named with the next available RFC number and a short description, for example, `rfcs/0000-my-feature.md`.
4. **Write the RFC**: Use the provided RFC template to draft your proposal.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the main repository’s `rfcs` branch. Mark the pull request with the RFC label.

### Step 2: Community Review

1. **Announcement**: Announce the RFC on the relevant communication channels (e.g., mailing list, Slack, GitHub Discussions).
2. **Discussion**: Engage with the community in the pull request comments. Incorporate feedback and revise the RFC as needed.
3. **Consensus**: Strive to reach consensus on the proposal. Significant changes should be reflected in the RFC document.

### Step 3: Refinement

1. **Incorporate Feedback**: Update the RFC based on community and maintainer feedback.
2. **Final Comment Period (FCP)**: Once the discussion has settled, a maintainer will propose a “Final Comment Period” lasting 7 days. This is the last chance for community input.

### Step 4: Approval

1. **Approval and Merge**: If there are no major unresolved issues at the end of the FCP, a maintainer will merge the RFC into the repository.
2. **Implementation**: Begin developing and integrating the approved change or feature. Ensure thorough testing and documentation.

# RFC: Add New Feature X

## Summary

This RFC proposes the addition of Feature X to improve scalability.

## Motivation

Feature X will enable the architecture to handle higher loads more efficiently.

## Detailed Design

The design includes the following components:
- Component A
- Component B

## Impact

This change will enhance scalability without affecting existing features.

## Alternatives Considered

Alternative approaches were considered but were not chosen due to complexity.

## Implementation

1. Develop Component A.
2. Integrate Component B.

## Open Questions

- How will this affect performance under high load?

## Conclusion

Feature X will improve scalability and is ready for community review.
