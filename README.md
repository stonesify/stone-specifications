Stone Specifications are a set of guidelines and standards designed to guide the development, configuration, implementation, and deployment of Omniplex applications. These specifications aim to ensure consistency, flexibility, and scalability across all applications built within the Continuum Architecture.

## Key Features of Stone Specifications

1. **Language-Agnostic:**
  - Abstract specifications not tied to any specific language, allowing implementation in any programming language.

2. **Core Stone Framework Specifications:**
  - Includes the core specifications for the Stone Framework, which can be used to develop specific Stone frameworks.

3. **Consistency Across Frameworks:**
  - All new features are documented here to ensure coherence and uniformity across different framework implementations.

4. **Source of Truth:**
  - Serves as the definitive guide for all Stone applications, facilitating understanding and use of any framework based on these specifications.

5. **Facilitate Framework Development:**
  - Provides a roadmap for the community to implement the Stone Framework in various languages, ensuring ease of transition for developers between frameworks.

6. **Modular Design:**
  - Each module is analyzed, problems are identified, and global design solutions are proposed, allowing implementation in different specific frameworks.

## Scope

The scope of Stone Specifications includes:

- **Problem Identification:**
  - Identify and describe problems through thorough analysis.
  
- **Solution Proposals:**
  - Propose solutions for the identified problems, focusing on global design.
  
- **Global Design:**
  - Provide a global design that can be implemented in various specific frameworks.
  
- **Detailed Design:**
  - Detailed design is not included in the specifications and is to be carried out within specific frameworks.

## Vision and Mission

**Vision:** To create a unified set of specifications that ensure consistency, flexibility, and scalability across Omniplex applications built using the Continuum Architecture.

**Mission:** To provide comprehensive, language-agnostic guidelines that facilitate the development, configuration, implementation, and deployment of Omniplex applications, enabling developers to build scalable, adaptable, and consistent applications.

## Benefits of Stone Specifications
